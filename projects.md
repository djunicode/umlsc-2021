One of UMLSC's main goals is to prepare you to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world tasks, or to leave you well-qualified to start machine learning or AI research. The final project is intended to start you in these directions.

UMLSC conducted 'Demo Day', that allowed students to showcase their final projects to an esteemed panel comprising researchers and industry leaders from universities such as CMU and MIT, and companies such as Google and Octane.

The projects were ranked on the basis of Intellectual Merit, Execution or Experimental Discussion, and Presentation.
